# Customer Overview

Equiem’s (www.equiem.com.au) world-first integrated technology and services platform provides exclusive access to amenity, convenience and information. The digital platform transforms the way every single person in a precinct connects and communicates. As well as being online, they are also onsite: finding out about tenants’ likes and gripes, making their day easier with first-class services, hunting out stories and engaging them with initiatives that enrich their lives, championing retailers, assisting building management, and reporting back to owners.
The result? Greater happiness and convenience for tenants, increased brand awareness and sales for retailers, improved communication for building managers, activated communities, and unparalleled value for asset owners.

# Business Challenge

Equiem have developed their digital platform and expanded on it since their inception. As a startup, they were driven to try to rapidly identify which aspects of their platform provided value to customers. This led to a series of MVP experiments that proved very successful. However this also led to a platform that consisted of features that while valuable, did not provide a polished user experience. With competitors entering the market, improving the customer experience was seen as a top priority.

# Solution

The events system was seen as a critical component of the Equiem offering but it needed to provide an improved user experience. Cevo worked with Equiem to significantly enhance the events system. This process included story writing workshops, coaching the development team in agile methodologies and user acceptance testing.

# Benefits

The execution of this value add project surfaced several interesting learnings for Equiem:
The flexibility of their technology stack was limiting in terms of what could be achieved from a user experience view as well the amount of time it took to make changes.
Spending the time on polishing features was worth the effort, as the new events system helped seal a contract with a new client.
