# Customer Overview
An ASX100 company and one of the largest publicly listed gambling companies in the world.

Their iconic brands, their stable of subscription television channels, ignite passion and excitement in millions of customers each year.

# Business Challenge

The company runs Active Directory to manage all of their user permissions and profiles. The growing number of applications being developed and hosted externally in the cloud has brought to light the large amount overhead required to integrate each with Active Directory.

# Solution

The original challenge was solved by creating a repeatable deployment and auto-configuration process, between Active Directory and external applications, which automated the authentication process through ADFS (Federation Services) hosted on AWS. Due to the complexity of the Active Directory additional workflows needed to be created which resulted in a fully automated solution.

# Benefits

The original challenge was evaluated and it was identified that only part automation would be completed unless the solution was restructured. Within the original timeframe set the entire process was re-engineered to achieve end to end automation of the ADFS integration process. This reduced a manual process taking upwards of 2 weeks to a push button solution completing in under 30 minutes.
