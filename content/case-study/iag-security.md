# Industry

Insurance services

# Customer Overview

IAG sell insurance under many leading brands including NRMA Insurance, CGU, SGIO, SGIC, Swann Insurance and WFI (Australia); NZI, State, AMI and Lumley Insurance (New Zealand); Safety and NZI (Thailand); AAA Assurance (Vietnam); and Asuransi Parolamas (Indonesia).

# Business Challenge

IAG had approximately 100 applications sitting on physical servers with a strategic direction to migrate to AWS. Before this could begin, we needed to ensure that all environments met APRA regulations.

# Solution

IAG and Cevo worked with APRA to clarify and document a list of compliance requirements. The team then wrote a tool called "Watchmen" that was governed by 40 unique security policies that would scan each environment and report on compliance with these policies. Where an environment did not conform to the security policies, the tool would report this exception and where the exception occurred.

# Benefits

The migration had been delayed because of the time it would have taken for the security team weeks to manually check the compliance of any given AWS account. "Watchman" has allowed IAG to confidently approve the migration of applications to pre-authorised environments. Now IAG can move forward with their AWS migration knowing that "Watchman" automatically checks the environments daily ensuring continual compliance with security procedures and APRA.

Both IAG and Cevo hope to open-source Watchman over the coming weeks and are working towards that end.
