# Customer Overview

Factor5™ is a startup looking to disrupt the way universities approach academic and student administration by modernising curriculum management 
through a highly configurable, cloud-based curriculum lifecycle management solution that supports the people and the processes.

# Business Challenge

Factor5™ is a fast moving startup with their main offering 'Courseloop', under active development with frequent & continuous deployments. 
These deployments are currently very time consuming and do not guarantee reliability. With Factor5™ scaling to commence development on two more product 
offerings, the overhead strain was only going to become exacerbated. Hence, they wanted to implement a better and more sustainable way to perform 
and track deployments.

# Solution

The team kicked off with workshops and realised that the non-conventional nature of the development workflow on top of 
the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">'ServiceNow'</a> platform was going to require some creativity to work with. A hybrid solution which 
implemented bespoke and ServiceNow native elements was proposed. This paved the way for the team to implement a more automated deployment 
method, packaging the changes into a singular item which could also be extracted from the ServiceNow platform into a version control system.

# Benefits

The Factor5™ team is now able to conduct deployments of Courseloop much quicker than before, but importantly they have the confidence that 
deployments will occur without issue and no longer depending on human intervention.
