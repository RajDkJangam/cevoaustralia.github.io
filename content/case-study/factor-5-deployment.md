# Customer Overview

Factor5 is a startup looking to disrupt  the way universities approach academic and student administration by modernising curriculum management through a highly configurable, cloud-based curriculum lifecycle management solution that supports the people and processes.

# Business Challenge

Factor5 is a fast moving startup with their main offering 'Courseloop', under active development and undergoing frequent update deployments. These deployments are currently very time consuming and do not guarantee reliability. With Factor5 beginning development on two more product offerings shortly, the problem was only going to become exacerbated. They therefore wanted to implement a better way to perform and track deployments.

# Solution

The team did some workshops and realised the the non-conventional nature of the development workflow on top of the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">'ServiceNow'</a> platform was a pain point that needed be addressed before moving forward. A hybrid solution which implemented bespoke and native to ServiceNow and elements was proposed. This paved the way for the team to implement a more automated deployment method, packaging the changes into a singular item which can also be extracted from the ServiceNow platform into version control.

# Benefits

The ServiceNow team is now able to conduct deployments of Courseloop much quicker than before, but importantly they have the confidence that deployments will occur without issue due to the lack of human intervention.
