### Industry

Tertiary Education

### Customer Overview

Our client is one of Australia’s largest and most international universities. As a truly global institution, there are five Australian campuses, a campus in Malaysia, a joint graduate school in China, a learning centre in Italy, and a research centre in India. A research-intensive university, they are known for some significant and lasting discoveries that have delivered impact beyond the academic community.

### Business Challenge

One of the key benefits of undertaking a cloud transformation adoption strategy is unlocking the potential to move fast and reduce the overheads with respect to existing infrastructure provisioning processes.

In the University’s case, IT staff were spending a significant amount of time manually provisioning services within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. The delays in getting code deployed was impacting the ability for the teams to deliver their value to the business and also increasing the cost of delivery.

Whilst the AWS adoption had already begun for our client, the real benefit was not being realised due to manual activities still being one of the biggest constraints.

### Solution

Cevo consultants worked alongside the IT staff to create a semi-automated process to reduce the amount of repetition in building environments.  This approach was not about ‘automate at all cost’, but focused on automating the highly repetitive actions, unlocking capacity within the existing teams to focus on higher value activities.

Through automation approaches, the actions required to create an environment became explicitly clear, enabling a whole new level of collaboration between teams to review and identify opportunities for reuse.

### Benefits

A significant reduction in time was achieved, allowing the University to set up their servers and deploy code faster. A cost saving was also found through the reduction in duplicating manual processes.

In addition, the patterns identified during this approach are able to be repurposed for additional solutions. This outcome helps the University extend their existing patterns and toolkits into new application design patterns.
