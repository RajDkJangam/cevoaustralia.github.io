Cevo were engaged to help kick us off on our DevOps journey and address two of our most pressing needs in reducing the time taken to deploy changes and improve the consistency of our deployments.  The Cevo consultants were first rate and easily integrated with our team. Together with our development team they forged a realistic plan and assessed & spiked options to validate approaches, this lead to a defined path for us going forward. We have now implemented these changes to the way our team develops and releases product, and we're on our way to being able to deploy our products with greater confidence and certainty.
