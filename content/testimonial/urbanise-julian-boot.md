Cevo were great. They listened to the goals of our project, what the team needed and they provided great engineers who were exactly what we required. We've been running iterative development for years and needed seasoned agile developers who could blend into the team and immediately contribute in the next sprint. That's who we got. Full-stack experience, and capable from the front end end UI down to automation of AWS infrastructure commissioning. They were a perfect addition to our team and meant we could get the project delivered much more quickly.
