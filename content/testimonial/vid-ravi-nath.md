Our developers could have gone through self-training to learn the AWS framework which would have taken a few weeks, however the methodology that Cevo took us through in the 3 days allowed our solution to be deployed to AWS’s infrastructure in time for client testing. During the 3 days with Cevo our team also gained enough knowledge to maintain and further solidify the solution through Continuous Integration ... Without Cevo’s assistance we would have spent almost three weeks getting up to speed with AWS.
