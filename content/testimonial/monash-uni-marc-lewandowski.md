Cevo assisted us in migrating our critical Student Administration applications to AWS whilst educating the team on the concepts and tools used in a cloud environment.
Our applications are now taking advantage of the native abilities of the Cloud such as self-healing and autoscaling infrastructure. Using a CI/CD pipeline allows us to deploy changes into Production within minutes rather than hours because handover between our developers and operations staff has been eliminated.
