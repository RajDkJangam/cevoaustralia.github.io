Thanks to the Baymax team (Nikita, Owen and Amy) who provided an on demand version of one of Tabcorp's legacy Host systems. With a very well planned roadmap on how they would achieve this, they were able to provide the Rubix team a version of Host which was hosted in AWS and allowed the Rubix team to start work earlier on a key business initiative. The ability for the team to use multiple versions on the Host at once allowed each developer to have a local environment to use and also create an integration environment for the scrum team to use that would not impact our primary test environment. The Baymax team have been very helpful and open to suggestions to improve the solution. We are now currently working on replacing a our Primary Host in our test environment with this solution allowing us to decommission up to 11 physical servers in our primary environment.
