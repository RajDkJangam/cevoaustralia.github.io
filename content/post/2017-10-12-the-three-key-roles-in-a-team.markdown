excerpt: 3W1H is short hand for The What, The Why, Then When & The How
---

Reflecting back on my professional work history, I have found that there are three equality important roles that make up a successful delivery team. These roles can be represented by what I called 3W1H, based on the shorthand 5W1H of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws>"Five Ws"</a>.

## 3W1H

If you haven't guessed already, 3W1H stands for

- _What_

- _Why_

- _When_

- _How_

#### The What & Why

_What is the purpose of the work initiative? Why are we doing it?_

The What & Why person is largely a Product Owner, Business Stakeholder or Product Manager. Their job is to set the purpose of what to do and why to do it.


#### The How

_How will we do this?_

The How person provides a key role on the technical aspect of what is being done. Commonly in progressive Agile Delivery places, the How person is a Technical Lead or Lead Developer or Architect.


#### The When

_When will this be done?_

The When person owns the delivery roadmap. They are generally their Iteration Manager, Scrum Master or Delivery Lead.  Their job is to make sure that the team is working on the most important thing and has an understanding of when it will will be done.


In my experience these three roles generally form the leadership of a team. The success of the team is relative to the working dynamic of its leadership. Ensure you have the right people in these roles and you're more likely to succeed than otherwise.
