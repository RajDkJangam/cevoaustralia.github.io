    Time to show what you've got

# Showcasing

I've found regular showcases one of the most effective tools in the Agile bag of tricks.

Here are some of the things I've used showcases for.

## Showing your work
Well this one is pretty obvious. However sometimes teams don't think the work they do is showcaseable, or that only 'customer facing' applications should be showcased. I believe that if you are taking a product based approach to your work (which you should be! see my other blog post: ) showcases defiantly should be part of your teams rituals.

## Keeping the team focused
One issue I've commonly come across in enterprise is the 'but in the future' argument. Anytime a decision is about to be made someone says 'but in the future we might need X'. This can often come from the best of intentions, but impedes getting any work done. Having a regular showcase means the team must focus on getting something built for that week. Otherwise you have a showcase with nothing to show.

## Keeping the team motivated
Showing off work to others and getting feedback on it, good or bad can be a great way to keep the team motivated. Even not so good feedback means that someone actually cares about what your building enough to comment on it!

## Knowledge sharing
Showcases don't just have to be about the working software (although working software must be there!). Just as important can be sharing some of the pain, frustration, and joy behind the working software. For example, maybe your team tried adopting pair programming and found it really help reduce the amount of defects in testing or you spent more time doing UI wire frame walk throughs with users. The story being the software can sometime make people appreciate more what they are seeing on screen

## Remove the fear of building the wrong thing
Getting a shared understanding of what the "right" thing to build means can be very very difficult. Some teams are petrified of building the wrong thing and being seen as a "bad" team. I found that convincing the team to show their work every week, and not worrying about the finer details of rightness removed this fear. At worst, if people don't like it you lost a week of work. At best, you just saved hours and hours of meetings. I've found that most people don't really know what they want until they see something in front of them and working anyway!


Hopefully this has given you some food for thought on the different ways that showcases can benefit your team.
