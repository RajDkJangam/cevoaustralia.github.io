Moving to the cloud is a great way for organisations to achieve scale and resilience. Engineering the cloud requires the ability to write code for constrained infrastructure. This will raise the bar for your delivery teams, requiring architectural approaches along with software delivery practices that achieve resilience by baking quality into the development lifecycle.

### Good software delivery practices

It’s no secret that Cloud is here to stay. Be it your favourite’s coffee shop, academic institutions, insurance provider, medical services or financial institution - scaling business, acquiring new customers and ensuring uptime is key to a successful business. Engaging customers via a compelling digital touch point such as web, mobile, kiosk, intelligent bots are increasingly crucial in keeping a healthy and happy customer base.

At [Cevo, we recognise this](/cases/cloud) and have been at the forefront of delivering cloud solutions for our customers. We offer a variety of services including cloud migration, cloud first and a hybrid approach of on-premise and cloud infrastructure. We understand that cloud by itself will not solve all challenges, thus we also consult with our customers around build their software “cloud friendly” right from the beginning. We believe that infrastructure automation and software architecture are the underpinning of a solid cloud strategy.
We do not believe in a build and transfer approach to our delivery. We work closely with customer teams across software development, project planning and operations to ensure that we build solutions that suits the needs of the business.


We do not believe in keeping it to ourselves and are big promoters of open source software. We believe that knowledge shared is knowledge gained. [Our blogs](/categories/aws) and presence at various conferences is a testimony to our beliefs.
