  DevOps is about developers and operations working together to deliver better software. A DevOps mindset continuously seeks new ways to break down silos, remove bottlenecks, and eliminate inefficiencies â€” all while holding ourselves to a higher standard of software quality and reliability.

### COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION

Devops is an ideal, a set of principles, a mindset. It is not a tool, methodology, or a set of practices. Building a DevOps culture is creating teams that value speed to market, customer feedback to validate the value in work delivered, quality, automation, scalability and reliability. We want to realise value quickly and can measure this based on how fast an organisation can move a single line of code from development to production. That is why DevOps is as much about change management as technical capability.

A key component of the devops movement is empathy, writing quality code that does not wake someone else up at 3am needing repair. This is why the agile principles are key to the devops movement.
