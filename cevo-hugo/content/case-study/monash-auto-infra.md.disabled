# Customer Overview

Monash University is Australia’s largest and most international university offering undergraduate, postgraduate and research courses. Monash is a research-intensive university, known for some significant and lasting discoveries that have delivered impact beyond the academic community.

Monash is a truly global institution, with five Australian campuses, a campus in Malaysia, a joint graduate school in China, a learning centre in Italy, and a research centre in India. Monash University courses are also delivered at other locations, including at Monash South Africa. At Monash, cultural experiences are lived, not described.

# Business Challenge

Monash staff were spending a significant amount of time manually provisioning services within the AWS environment. This was impacting the ability for the teams to deliver their value to the business through delays in getting code deployed, thus increasing the cost of delivery.
One of the key benefits of undertaking a cloud transformation adoption strategy is to unlock the potential to move fast and reduce the overheads with respect to existing infrastructure provisioning processes.
While the AWS adoption had started, the real benefit was not being realised due to manual activities still being one of the biggest constraints.

# Solution

A semi automated process was created to reduce the amount of repetition in building environments.  This approach was not about ‘automate at all cost’, but was focused on automating the highly repetitive actions, unlocking capacity within the existing teams to focus on higher value activities.
Through automation approaches, the actions required to create an environment became explicitly clear, enabling a whole new level of collaboration between teams to review and identify opportunities for reuse.

# Benefits

A significant reduction in time was achieved allowing Monash to more quickly setup their servers and deploy their code. A cost saving was also found through the reduction in duplicating manual process.  
The patterns identified during this approach are able to be re-purposed for additional solutions helping Monash extend their existing patterns and toolkits into new application design patterns.
