I recently gave a talk at at [Infracoders meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Infrastructure-Coders/) titled 'Greenfields tech decisions'

In summary I highlighted three points:
* Don't put the same level of importance on all decisions - avoid ['bikesheading'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding)
* It's imperative that you factor in your people in the decisions
* Start small and iterate - as a start-up focus on shipping over gold-plating
